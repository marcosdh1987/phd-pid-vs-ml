	abstract = {In this study, a dynamic simulator for three-phase gravity separators in oil production facilities is proposed. The mass conservation equation is established to calculate the pressure, water level, and oil level in the separator and the mass balance equation of the dispersed phase to calculate the oil−water separation efficiency. The proportional integral controllers are applied to control the water level, oil level, and pressure in the separator by setting the opening of the three outlet valves of oil, gas, and water. The model is verified using field data by means of the given valve opening and given proportional integral controller parameters, respectively. Subsequently, the verified simulator is applied to study the dynamic behavior of the separator filling process and the effect of pressure, oil level, and water level setpoint changes on the separator operating status. A detailed analysis of the changes in the liquid level, pressure, and opening of three outlet valves is presented. Then, the effects of operating conditions such as the inlet flow, water setpoint, and weir height on the separation efficiency are discussed. This simulator can be applied for the design of oil, gas, and water three-phase separation processes. In addition, through this simulator, the parameters that are difficult to be measured by instruments during the operation of the separator can be calculated, providing technical support for the construction of the digital twin of the separator.},

	abstract = {Artiﬁcial intelligence techniques for pneumatic robot manipulators have become of deep interest in industrial applications, such as non-high voltage environments, clean operations, and high power-to-weight ratio tasks. The principal advantages of this type of actuator are the implementation of clean energies, low cost, and easy maintenance. The disadvantages of working with pneumatic actuators are that they have non-linear characteristics. This paper proposes an intelligent controller embedded in a programmable logic device to minimize the non-linearities of the air behavior into a 3-degrees-of-freedom robot with pneumatic actuators. In this case, the device is suitable due to several electric valves, direct current motors signals, automatic controllers, and several neural networks. For every degree of freedom, three neurons adjust the gains for each controller. The learning process is constantly tuning the gain value to reach the minimum of the mean square error. Results plot a more appropriate behavior for a transitive time when the neurons work with the automatic controllers with a minimum mean error of ±1.2 mm.},

	abstract = {This paper is a study of reinforcement learning (RL) as an optimal-control strategy for control of nonlinear valves. It is evaluated against the PID (proportional–integral–derivative) strategy, using a unified framework. RL is an autonomous learning mechanism that learns by interacting with its environment. It is gaining increasing attention in the world of control systems as a means of building optimal-controllers for challenging dynamic and nonlinear processes. Published RL research often uses open-source tools (Python and OpenAI Gym environments). We use MATLAB’s recently launched (R2019a) Reinforcement Learning Toolbox™ to develop the valve controller; trained using the DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy-Gradient) algorithm and Simulink® to simulate the nonlinear valve and create the experimental test-bench for evaluation. Simulink allows industrial engineers to quickly adapt and experiment with other systems of their choice. Results indicate that the RL controller is extremely good at tracking the signal with speed and produces a lower error with respect to the reference signal. The PID, however, is better at disturbance rejection and hence provides a longer life for the valves. Successful machine learning involves tuning many hyperparameters requiring significant investment of time and efforts. We introduce ‘‘Graded Learning" as a simplified, application oriented adaptation of the more formal and algorithmic ‘‘Curriculum for Reinforcement Learning’’. It is shown via experiments that it helps converge the learning task of complex non-linear real world systems. Finally, experiential learnings gained from this research are corroborated against published research.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear dynamics of control valves, such as stiction, can produce significant performance degradation in the control loops where they are involved. There are several works in the literature describing and modelling these phenomena and proposing different compensation methods, such as the inclusion of dead-band, knockers, etc. in the PID controllers. These previous studies in the literature have only focused on expensive industrial control valves, mainly pneumatic. However, there are other applications, such as heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in vehicles, that use low-cost electric valves and where similar undesired phenomena arise. This is the first work in the literature focused on these low-cost control valves. We studied and modelled their nonlinearities and analysed the performance of different compensation methods, both those proposed for industrial control valves by other authors and new ones proposed as a combination of them. This comparative analysis is performed in simulation and experimentally for a control temperature system in coaches. For a quantitative comparison, two performance indices, one related to the tracking setpoint and the other to the valve lifespan, are considered. The results show that for this kind of valves, the simplest method, the dead-band in the PID controller, obtains the best trade-off between these indices and shows the best advantages because it is the easiest solution to tune and implement as well as being the most robust.},

	abstract = {Leakage problems occur from time to time due to the large number of equipment and complex processes during oil and gas production and transportation. The traditional detection methods highly depend on manpower with large workload and are prone to missed and false alarms, which seriously affects the efficiency and safety of oil and gas production and transportation. With the continuous improvement of information technology and the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), the research on leakage detection technology based on AI methods has attracted more and more attention. This paper discusses the application scenarios of an AI agent based on the recently emerged large language model (LLM) technology in oil and gas production leakage detection: (1) Compared with the traditional leakage detection methods, this paper innovatively employs a combination of AI-based diagnostics and infrared temperature measurement technologies to develop a specialized small model for oil and gas leakage detection, which has been proven to significantly improve the accuracy of detecting industrial venting events in natural gas valve chambers; (2) By employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technology, a knowledge vector library is constructed, utilizing a series of leakage-related documents, assisting the LLM to carry out knowledge questioning and inference. Compared with the traditional SimBERT, the accuracy can be improved by about 15\% in the Q\&A search ability test. The correct rate is about 70\% higher than the SimBERT in the Chinese complex reasoning quiz. Also, it can still remain stable under high load conditions, with the interruption rate of retrieval closing to zero. (3) By combining the specialized small model and the knowledge Q\&A tool, the natural gas valve chambers’ leakage detection AI agent based on the open-source LLM model was designed and developed, which preliminarily achieved the leakage detection based on the specialized small model, and the automatic processing of the retrieval reasoning process based on the knowledge Q\&A tool and the intelligent generation of corresponding leakage disposal scheme. The effectiveness of the method has been verified by actual project data. This article conducts preliminary explorations into the in-depth applications of AI agents based on LLMs in the oil and gas energy industry, demonstrating certain positive outcomes.},

	abstract = {Electric throttle valves represent a challenge for control design, as their dynamics involve strong nonlinearities, characterized by an asymmetric hysteresis. Carrying experiments on multiple valves, a large variability in the characteristics of each valve and erratic steady-state behaviors can also be noticed, impairing classical model-based control strategies. Nevertheless, local data-driven linear models can be obtained and simple proportional-integral (PI) controllers, tuned individually for each valve with the appropriate data set, provide good tracking performance. As these controllers cannot be transposed from one valve to another, a robust strategy and an adaptive controller (using identiﬁcation in closed-loop and controller re-design) may be necessary to propose a general method. This work aims at promoting control education on a simple yet challenging process, going from frequency analysis and linear design to an adaptive control method implemented with an online recursive algorithm.},
